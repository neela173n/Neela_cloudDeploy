 Deploying ToDo list application on cloud 
-
In this project , I have deployed a to-do app, which allows us to add our day to day tasks,edit and delete tasks once its completed. This application is deployed using Google cloud Platform for enabling public to access the application.

set up and runnning the application:
-
Install python 3.13.1 and run the execution file and complete the process of download.

Install the open source python framework in the same directory, and FLASK which helps us to design a flexible application.

VS code is used as the source code editor to save and run the  codes required for effective functioning of the website. The file structure is as follows:

-->main.py (backend code for flask)
